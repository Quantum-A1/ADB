**Welcome to the DayZ Alt Detector Bot**

The DayZ Alt Detector Bot is designed to detect and manage potential alternate (alt) accounts on your DayZ console servers. It integrates with Nitrado server logs, processes player connection data, and stores this data in a MySQL database. The bot scans logs every 5 minutes, detects potential alt accounts based on shared device IDs, and sends alerts to a specific Discord channel.
